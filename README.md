# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. Also, I have attached the deployment link. 

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I created a web page to display all characters from Rick and Morty API using JavaScript and React framework. It includes other features such as searching for a specific character, modal display, and pagination.I created a web page to display all characters from Rick and Morty API using JavaScript and React framework.
